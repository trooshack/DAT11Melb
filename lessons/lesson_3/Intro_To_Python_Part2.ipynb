    "## Why Use Python for Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### General Purpose, Open Source, and Readability\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the more prominent reasons Python has been so widely adopted for data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General purpose:** Python was not intended to just be used for software or website development. Instead, it comes with the basic building blocks you need to develop anything you want with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open source:** Going back to the \"basic building blocks\" point — a large open-source community has already created hundreds of libraries containing combinations of the foundation blocks to create more specific tool sets. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "- Requests: Interacting with websites.\n",
    "- Django: Python web framework.\n",
    "- Pandas: Data scientists' best friend.\n",
    "- Pyglet: GUI application building.\n",
    "- TensorFlow: Google's machine learning library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Readability:** They're called programming languages because learning them is similar to learning a written language, but instead of learning how to communicate with a person, you're learning how to communicate with a computer. When a foreign language is similar to your native language, it's much easier to pick up. The same can be said for Python, whose general flow makes it a lot easier for humans to read and interpret code."

    "\n",
    "**Floats:** Short for \"floating point number,\" usually used with decimals such as 2.8 or 3.14159.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strings:** A set of letters, numbers, or other characters, e.g., \"The fox is quick.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuples:** An ordered sequence with a fixed number of elements, e.g., in x = (1, 2, 3), the parentheses makes it a tuple. x = (\"Kirk\", \"Picard\", \"Spock\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lists:** An ordered sequence without a fixed number of elements, e.g., x = [1, 2, 3]. Note the square brackets. x = [\"Lord\", \"of\", \"the\", \"Rings\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dictionaries**: An unordered collection of key-value pairs, e.g., x = {'Mark': 'Twain', 'Apples': 5}. To retrieve each value (the part after each colon), use its key (the part before each colon). For example, x['Apples'] retrieves the value 5.\n",

    "`while` loops are a different means of performing repetitive tasks/iteration. The function of a `for` loop is to perform tasks over a _finite list_. The function of a `while` loop is to perform a repetitive task until a _specific threshold or criteria point is met_. Keep in mind that this can be relatively dangerous, as it is easy to create a loop that never meets your criteria and runs forever.\n",
